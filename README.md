# Assembly Programming Exercises For RISC-V Core

This repository contains **Assembly programming exercises** implemented for the **RISC-V Core (RVfpga)** running on the **Nexys A7 FPGA board**.

Each exercise demonstrates fundamental **assembly-level programming concepts** such as loops, arrays, sorting, and arithmetic operations â€” all implemented using **memory-mapped I/O** for hardware interaction with **LEDs and switches**.
